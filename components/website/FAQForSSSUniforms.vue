                  <p>
                    In our years of operation, we have found the following
                    benefits of wearing the uniform:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Discipline:</strong> The lesson starts the moment
                      a child puts on their uniform. We have a set of values we
                      teach in our classes. The kit represents those values and
                      can change children’s state of mind the moment they wear
                      it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Improved behaviour:</strong> It is reported that
                      when children wear a uniform, schools often report
                      improved discipline and concentration. Once they put it
                      on, their purpose is to work hard in the lessons. A sense
                      of professionalism develops within each child.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>A feeling of equality:</strong> The kit brings
                      everyone to the same platform, no matter their background,
                      race, gender or class and thus inculcating a feeling of
                      equality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>A sense of belonging:</strong> Our uniform plays a
                      key role in promoting pride, self-confidence, and a
                      feeling of belonging within the group. This can be
                      particularly helpful for those students who feel shy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Safety:</strong> With their football colours on,
                      children can immediately be recognised at a distance as a
                      member of that soccer school.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>A sense of pride:</strong> What child doesn’t like
                      a new football kit? Football kits promote a sense of pride
                      for children.
                    </li>
